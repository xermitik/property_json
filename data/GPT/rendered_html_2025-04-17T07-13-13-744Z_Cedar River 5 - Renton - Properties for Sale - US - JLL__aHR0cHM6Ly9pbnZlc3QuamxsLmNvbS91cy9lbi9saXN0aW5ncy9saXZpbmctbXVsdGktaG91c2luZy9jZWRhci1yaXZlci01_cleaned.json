Ownership has kept both unit interiors and building exteriors well-maintained, including new electrical panels in 2025 and updated roofs in 2020, making this an attractive asset in a desirable submarket proximate to Seattle’s core demand-drivers.\n\nLocated along the scenic Cedar River, residents at the Property benefit from suburban living with easy access to the major employment hubs of downtown Seattle, the Eastside, and the Kent Industrial Corridor. Situated in central Renton, residents are also proximate to a variety of retail and entertainment amenities.
